    "    - In the above code, we have configured the `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to allow requests from `http://localhost:5173` (the React frontend created using Vite). We have also configured the `DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES` to use the `JWTAuthentication` class for authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Include the authentication URLs in [backend/backend/urls.py](backend/backend/urls.py).\n",
    "\n",

    "    ]\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In the above code, we have defined three endpoints:\n",
    "      - `/api/token/`: Endpoint to obtain the JWT token.\n",
    "      - `/api/token/refresh/`: Endpoint to refresh the JWT token. Thiis is useful when the access token expires.\n",
    "      - `/api/register/`: Endpoint for user registration.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Create the authentication views:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Insert the following code in [backend/authentication/views.py](backend/authentication/views.py):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In the above code, we have defined a `RegisterView` class that handles user registration. The view extends the `CreateAPIView` class and includes the `RegisterSerializer` for serializing user data. The view creates a new user and generates a JWT token for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A serializer is a class that converts complex data types, such as querysets and model instances, into native Python data types that can then be easily rendered into JSON, XML, or other content types. Serializers also provide deserialization, allowing parsed data to be converted back into complex types after validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  **Create the authentication serializers:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Create a new file [backend/authentication/serializers.py](backend/authentication/serializers.py) and add the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from django.contrib.auth.models import User\n",
    "    from rest_framework import serializers\n",

    "                password=validated_data['password']\n",
    "            )\n",
    "            return user\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In the above code, we have defined a `RegisterSerializer` class that extends the `ModelSerializer` class. The serializer includes the `username`, `password`, and `email` fields from the `User` model. The `create` method creates a new user with the provided data.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Migrate the Database:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    python manage.py makemigrations\n",
    "    python manage.py migrate\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Create a superuser:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    python manage.py createsuperuser\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - You will be prompted to enter a username, email, and password for the superuser. This superuser can be used to access the Django admin interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Run the development server:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    python manage.py runserver\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Test the endpoints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Open a web browser or a tool like Postman and test the following endpoints:\n",
    "\n",
    "      - `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/register/`: Register a new user by sending a POST request with the `username`, `password`, and `email` fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "      - `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/`: Obtain a JWT token by sending a POST request with the `username` and `password` fields. Note that if you open the URL in your browser, you will get a `405 Method Not Allowed` error since browsers send GET requests by default. Use the `curl` command or a tool like Postman to send a POST request.\n",
    "\n",
    "      - `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/refresh/`: Refresh the JWT token by sending a POST request with the `refresh` field containing the refresh token.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - You can also test the endpoints using the React frontend that we will create in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Congratulations!** You have successfully set up a Django backend with JWT authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Frontend Setup (React)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start setting up the React frontend, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with React, you can follow the official React documentation to get started: [React - Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few terms you should be familiar with when working with React:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Components:** React components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable pieces of code that define how a part of the user interface should look and behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State:** State is a built-in feature in React that allows components to store and manage their own data. When the state of a component changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the updated state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Props:** Props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React. Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hooks:** Hooks are functions that allow functional components to use state and other React features. The most common hooks are `useState` for managing state and `useEffect` for performing side effects in functional components.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context:** Context provides a way to share data between components without having to pass props through every level of the component tree. It is useful for sharing global data, such as authentication state, across different parts of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Routing:** React Router is a popular library for handling routing in React applications. It allows you to define routes and navigate between different components based on the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **JSX:** JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in React components. JSX is compiled to regular JavaScript by tools like Babel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's set up the React frontend to interact with the Django backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Create a new React app using Vite:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - First, go back to the root directory of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Create a new React app using Vite by running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    npm init vite@latest frontend --template react\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Alternatively, you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    npm create vite@latest\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Then follow the prompts to create a new React app with the desired template.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Change to the `frontend` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    cd frontend\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Install Axios for making HTTP requests and React DOM Router:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    npm install axios react-router-dom\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    React Router is a popular library for handling routing in React applications. It allows you to define routes and navigate between different components based on the URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Install All Dependencies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    npm install\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Create a `services` directory:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Create a new directory named `services` inside the `src` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    mkdir src/services\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Create a new file [frontend/src/services/api.js](frontend/src/services/api.js) and add the following code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```js\n",
    "    import axios from \"axios\";\n",
    "\n",
    "    // TODO: change to env variable to prepare for deployment to production\n",

    "      baseURL: API_URL,\n",
    "    });\n",
    "\n",
    "    export const login = async (username, password) => {\n",
    "      const response = await api.post(\"/token/\", { username, password });\n",

    "    };\n",
    "\n",
    "    export const register = async (username, email, password) => {\n",
    "      const response = await api.post(\"/register/\", {\n",

    "    };\n",
    "\n",
    "    export default api;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    - In the above code, we have defined functions to interact with the authentication endpoints in the Django backend. The `login` function sends a POST request to the `/token/` endpoint with the `username` and `password` fields. The `register` function sends a POST request to the `/register/` endpoint with the `username`, `email`, and `password` fields. The `refreshToken` function sends a POST request to the `/token/refresh/` endpoint with the `refresh` field containing the refresh token.\n",
